Dear students, in this video I'm going to show and talk about the pressure sensor measurement.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Here you can see the measurement setup with sensors and instruments.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Here are the two sensors to be measured, an absolute and a relative pressure sensor. The sensors are in metal packages.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Both sensors are embedded in a metal block for purpose of changing and maintaining temperature.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:40.000
These tubes transmit pressurized air to the sensors, coming from a compressor.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:51.000
The output pins of the sensors are down here, which are connected to the banana sockets up there.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:14.000
The schematic on top shows that a sensor is made by a resistor bridge of four resistors, with all four poles connected to sockets for measurement or supplying power,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
or even measuring resistances directly.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:29.000
The sensors each have a built-in thermistor (temperature sensor), one of which is connected to the sockets on the left.
