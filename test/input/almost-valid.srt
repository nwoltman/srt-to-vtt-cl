Dear students, in this video I'm going to show and talk about the pressure sensor measurement.

2
00:00:07,00 --> 00:00:11,00
Here you can see the measurement setup with sensors and instruments.

3
00:00:11,00 --> 00:00:21,00
Here are the two sensors to be measured, an absolute and a relative pressure sensor. The sensors are in metal packages.

4
00:00:21,00 --> 00:00:32,00
Both sensors are embedded in a metal block for purpose of changing and maintaining temperature.

5
00:00:32,00 --> 00:00:40,00
These tubes transmit pressurized air to the sensors, coming from a compressor.

6
00:00:40,00 --> 00:00:51,00
The output pins of the sensors are down here, which are connected to the banana sockets up there.

7
00:00:51,00 --> 00:01:14,00
The schematic on top shows that a sensor is made by a resistor bridge of four resistors, with all four poles connected to sockets for measurement or supplying power,

8
00:01:14,00 --> 00:01:19,00
or even measuring resistances directly.

9
00:01:20,00 --> 00:01:29,00
The sensors each have a built-in thermistor (temperature sensor), one of which is connected to the sockets on the left.
